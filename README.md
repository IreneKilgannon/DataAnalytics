# Analysis of the Palmer Penguins Data Set
***

Author: Irene Kilgannon

Student ID: G00220627

This repository is my analysis of the Palmer Penguins data set. This analysis was the assessment task for the module, Principles of Data Analytics as part of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics), Atlantic Technological University.


## Purpose of The Assessment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the following:
1. The sourcing and investigating of a data set, the Palmer penguins data set.
2. To programmatically explore and visualise data. 
3. To apply basic mathematical data analysis to the data set e.g. calculate the mean, standard deviation of a variable in the data set. 


## Outline of The Assessment

This assessment consists of two parts, the tasks and the project.

__The Tasks__
1. To create a GitHub repository with a README.md, a .gitignore and a Jupyter notebook entitled penguins.ipynb.
2. Upload the penguins data set to the Jupyter notebook and give an overview of the data set and the variables it contains.
3. Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model the variables with an explanation of the rationale.
4. Create a bar chart and a histogram of appropriate variables in the data set.

__The Project__

Select two variables from the data set and provide an analysis of how correlated they are.


## Get Started

__Step 1__ Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Anaconda is a Python distribution and comes with pre-installed packages such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) which are required for this project.

__Step 2__ Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

__Step 3__ Load the [palmer penguins data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv) into the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/IreneKilgannon/DataAnalytics/blob/main/penguins.ipynb) and get coding!
