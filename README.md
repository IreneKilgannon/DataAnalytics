# Analysis of the Palmer Penguins Data Set

This repository is my analysis of the Palmer Penguins data set. This analysis was the assessment task for the module, Principles of Data Analytics as part of the H. Dip in Science in Data Analytics, ATU.


## Purpose of The Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the following:
1. The sourcing and investigating of a data set
2. To programmatically explore and visualise data. 
3. To apply basic mathematical data analysis to the data set e.g. calculate the mean, standard deviation of a variable in the data set. 
4. Research and documentation 


## Outline of The Project

This project consists of two parts, the tasks and the project.

The Tasks
1. To create a GitHub repository with a README.md, a .gitignore and a Jupyter notebook entitled penguins.ipynb.
2. Upload the penguins data set to the Jupyter notebook and give an overview of the data set and the variables it contains.
3. Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model the variables with an explanation of the rationale.
4. Create a bar chart and a histogram of appropriate variables in the data set.

The Project
Select two variables from the data set and provide an analyis of how correlated they are.
